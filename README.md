# JavaScript Full Stack Mastery 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning journey toward mastering full-stack JavaScript development. This repository contains a curated collection of hands-on projects, each designed to build real-world skills across the JavaScript ecosystem—from vanilla JS to modern frameworks, backend, testing, and deployment.

## 🧭 Structure

Each folder represents a standalone project or module in the learning path. Projects are named sequentially to reflect progression and refactoring stages.

01-timer-app/ → Basic timer using vanilla JS 
01A-TimerStopwatchApp/ → Refactored version with stopwatch logic



## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Build modular, portfolio-ready projects
- ✅ Practice clean code, Git workflows, and documentation
- ✅ Explore frontend, backend, and fullstack patterns
- ✅ Commit daily for consistency and growth

## 📦 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB *(upcoming)*
- React, Next.js *(upcoming)*

## 🗂️ Commit Convention

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clarity and automation:

- `feat:` → new feature or project
- `fix:` → bug fix
- `chore:` → setup, config, or non-code changes
- `docs:` → documentation updates
- `refactor:` → code restructuring without changing behavior

## 📌 Status

This repository is actively maintained and updated.  
Projects are added progressively as part of a 30-minute daily coding challenge.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

Inspired by open-source learning, community-driven growth, and the joy of building things that work.
